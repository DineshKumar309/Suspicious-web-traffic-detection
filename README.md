# Suspicious-web-traffic-detection

The Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System is a machine learning-based web application designed to classify network traffic as either suspicious or normal. The project leverages supervised learning models to analyze network patterns and detect potential cyber threats. The system is deployed using Flask, providing an interactive web interface where users can input network parameters and receive real-time intrusion detection results.
